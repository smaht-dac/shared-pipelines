# Fast mode keeps a buffer of alignments in memory so that it can write out most pairs as soon as they are found instead of storing them in temporary files.
# This allows collate to avoid some work and so finish more quickly compared to the standard mode.
# The number of alignments held can be changed using -r, storing more alignments uses more memory but increases the number of pairs that can be written early.
# Setting it to 10,000,000, this will use around 12GB RAM.
